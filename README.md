# clip-j
A JavaScript Flash free clipboard implementation.
## Include in JavaScript
&lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/Triforcey/clip-j/master/clip-j.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
## Usage
clip('text-to-copy');

clip('&lt;img src="image to copy"&gt;);

## Important!
For security reasons, this only works when the user caused the clip command to run. This can be caused through clicking something, or something as little as moving their cursor.
