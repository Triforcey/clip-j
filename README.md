# clip-j
A JavaScript Flash free clipboard implementation.
## Include in JavaScript
&lt;script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Triforcey/clip-j/026a027/clip-j.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;

clip('text-to-copy');
## Important!
For security reasons, this only works when the user caused the clip command to run. This can be caused through clicking something, or something as little as moving their cursor.
